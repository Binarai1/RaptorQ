## 🚀 What is RaptorQ?

RaptorQ is the **first quantum-resistant cryptocurrency wallet** built for the Raptoreum blockchain. While other wallets will be broken by quantum computers in minutes, RaptorQ will remain secure for **billions of years**.

### 🎯 Simple Problem, Powerful Solution

**The Problem**: Current crypto wallets use old encryption that quantum computers can easily break.

**Our Solution**: RaptorQ uses **SHA3-2048 quantum security** - making it unbreakable even by future quantum computers.

## 🔬 The Science Behind Quantum Resistance

### Simple Explanation

**Classical Computers** work with bits (0 or 1)  
**Quantum Computers** work with qubits (0, 1, or both simultaneously)

This makes quantum computers exponentially faster at breaking current encryption, but RaptorQ's **SHA3-2048** security remains unbreakable because:

1. **Larger Key Space**: 2^1024 possible combinations (virtually infinite)
2. **Quantum-Resistant Algorithms**: Designed to resist quantum attacks
3. **Future-Proof Design**: Automatically adapts to new threats

---

## 💰 Economics & Tokenomics

### No Token, Pure Utility

RaptorQ focuses on **utility over speculation**:

- **No RaptorQ token** - Uses native RTM cryptocurrency
- **Transaction fees** - Standard Raptoreum network fees
- **Asset creation** - Pay in RTM for AI-generated NFTs
- **Pro features** - Optional premium features for power users

### Cost Comparison

| Feature | Traditional Wallets | RaptorQ |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| **Basic Wallet** | Free | Free |
| **Quantum Security** | Not Available | Free |
| **QR Codes** | Basic | Quantum Logo |
| **AI Assets** | Not Available | Small RTM fee |
| **Mobile Optimization** | Standard | 40% faster |
