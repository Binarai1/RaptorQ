The previous AI engineer initiated development based on a user request for a Discord bot, which evolved into a web-based Raptoreum wallet after platform limitations were identified. The project underwent several iterations, incorporating extensive user feedback. Key phases included initial web app scaffolding, re-branding from Talon Wallet to QUANTXO then RaptorQ, and a significant focus on quantum-resistant cryptography (SHA3-512 initially, then upgraded to SHA3-2048 equivalent). The engineer implemented core wallet features, asset management, UI/UX improvements, and comprehensive documentation. Challenges included continuous integration of new requirements, resolving UI glitches, and handling GitHub upload limitations. The work is currently focused on adding QR code functionality for transactions. The trajectory shows a strong emphasis on security, user experience, and robust blockchain integration with Raptoreum.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was for a Discord bot to send/receive Raptoreum coins/assets, display IPFS images, manage private keys, and check balances privately. Due to platform limitations, this pivoted to a web-based Talon Wallet (later QUANTXO, then RaptorQ), functioning like MetaMask. The wallet must feature secure private key management, seed phrase backup/recovery, UTXO/InstaSend transaction support, real-time balance, IPFS asset image display (PDF, MP3, MP4, PNG, JPG, GIF), asset minting/viewing, and mobile-style asset grid layout.

Crucial requirements include:
-   **Quantum Resistance:** Superior encryption (SHA3-2048 equivalent, 1024-bit quantum security), quantum-safe key derivation, self-healing security, post-quantum readiness.
-   **User Experience:** Clean, sharp UI with black, chrome, dark red theme; Poppins font; custom wallet colors; 2FA/3FA; lock function; real-time balance auto-refresh; smooth animations; seed phrase verification on creation.
-   **Asset Management:** Master/sub asset hierarchy, custom metadata with social media/website links, AI-powered NFT image/GIF creation, social sharing (Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok), asset liking/unliking, monitoring for inappropriate content.
-   **Raptoreum Integration:** Emphasis on Quantum Raptoreum revolutionizing UTXO, connection to websites, downloadable wallet for running a local node, auto-upgrade when new blockchain files are detected.
-   **Documentation:** Developer integration guide (secure, quantum-resistant), multi-platform user guides, legal disclaimer, quantum resistance comparison.
-   **Transaction Features:** Custom QR code for receiving (with wallet logo), copy address, device camera scan for sending RTM QR codes.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was working on enhancing the RaptorQ wallet based on recent user feedback. The immediate focus was on implementing QR code functionality for transactions. Specifically, the user requested:
1.  **Receive Functionality**: When clicking receive, the wallet should produce a custom QR code with the wallet logo in the middle, and allow copying of the selected address.
2.  **Send Functionality**: When sending a transaction, it should allow the option to securely use the device camera (mobile or desktop) to read other RTM QR codes.

The AI engineer has just initiated this task by stating: First, let me install the necessary QR code libraries: This indicates that the installation of dependencies for QR code generation and scanning is the current, ongoing work. The core QR code generation and scanning logic, along with UI integration, are yet to be implemented.
